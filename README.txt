Hi,
  We are glad that you reached our project. We have created an website to add volunteers/donators from all over india also to make donation avialable online
  anyone can register online the data will be stored and an id card will be provided for attendance purpose
  Secondly we have created an python application for admin controls to create qrcodes for volunteers and track there attendence. The volunters only need to show there 
  ID cards printed with a qr code and there attendence will be marked.
  
 
  App :
      Dowload the app files, then you need to instal some python packages, to do so run the below command in your terminal.
          pip install pyqrcode pypng opencv-python pandas pygame django
      All set you are ready to go in the working directory run the below command.
          python teens_of_god.py
          
      admin login:
        username : harsh

  Web : 
      After downloading open the folder app/web/ and open terminal in this directory then type the follow command
