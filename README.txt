Hi,
  We are glad taht you reached our project. We have created an website to add volunteers/donators from all over india also to make donation avialable online
  Secondly we have created an python application for admin controls to create qrcodes for volunteers and track there attendence. The volunters only need to show there 
  ID cards printed with a qr code and there attendence will be marked.
  
 There are two folders in the repository the web folder contains the website on other hand app has the admin application.
  App :
      Dowload the app files, then you need to instal some python packages, to do so run the below command in your terminal.
          pip install pyqrcode pypng opencv-python pandas pygame
      All set you are ready to go in the working directory run the below command.
          python teens_of_god.py
          
  Web : 
      After downloading the web folder open the index.html file in your browser and here is the website.
      
Thanks(Code on wings)
